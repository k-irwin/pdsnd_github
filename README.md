## Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Project**


## Description
* This project uses **Python** to analyze data from three **CSV files**.
* The files contain information on **Bikeshare** used in three separate markets; New York *City*, *Chicago*, and *Washington*.
* There is one file for each market.
* The project uses an interactive terminal to help the user select the data they are interested in viewing.

>Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
More information on bikesharing can be found [here] (https://www.motivateco.com/)


## Project Flow

* Get user name
* Ask user if they wat to see any data
* Select City, Month, and Day of the data
* Confirm the data selection
* Calculate and display the statistics from the data selection
* Ask if user wants to see raw data
* Ask user if they want to do another search


## Directions

* Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal and type **python bikeshare.py** to start.
* Follow the promts on screen to select data for analysis.
* Promts can accept *uppercase*, *lowercase*, or the corrisponding *number*.
* After the data is selected, the statistics will be diplayed base on the selection.
* Once the statistics are complete you will have the oportunity to see the *raw data*.
* When viewing the raw data, you will have the opportunity to select how many rows to view at a time.
* After the first group of rows is displayed, you can choose to view the next group of rows in the data.
* When you are done viewing the data you can continue with another search or exit the program.
