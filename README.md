## Project Title
**Bikeshare Data Project**


## Description
* This project uses **Python** to analize data from three **CSV files**.
* The files contain information on **Bikeshare** used in three separate markets; New York *City*, *Chicago*, and *Washington*.
* There is one file for each market.
* The project uses an interactive teminal to help the user select the data they are interested in viewing.

>Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride.
